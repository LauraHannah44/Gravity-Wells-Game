slow motion

parent body class with children for star, player, bullet, pellet, flame etc.
inherit acceleration-returning functions from parent, but have additional functions per child
store child-based acceleration functions with parent ones in a reference list to iterate a sum through

Body:
update iterations, age
position, velocity
mass, dmass, charge, dcharge
cohesion, alignment, separation
friction, elasticity
colours, radius

init
update, step, get collision
get gravitation acceleration, get static acceleration, get magnetic acceleration
get cohesion acceleration, get alignment acceleration, get separation acceleration
get friction acceleration, get collision acceleration
draw

Player:
angle, angular velocity
controls, stocks
shot_type, shot_class
threat to, damage, requirements for threat, threatened by, health, requirements for SD

init
get thrust, get angular thrust
fire, respawn
draw angle, draw able to fire
